/*
    --------
    - Polymorphism
    - + Compile time, early biding, static binding (EX: overloaded function/operator)
    - + Runtime, late binding, dynamic binding (EX: function overriding)
    --------

    --------
    - Base class pointer, base reference
    - 
    -
    --------

    --------
    - Virtual Function
    - + If a function is virtual, all matching overrides in derived classes are implicitly virtual.
    - + Never call virtual functions from constructors or destructors. If you were to call a virtual 
    -function from the Base constructor, and Derived portion of the class hadnâ€™t even been created yet,
    -
    --------

    --------
    - Virtual Destructor
    - + When a base class pointer is used to delete a derived class object, the destructor of the 
    -derived class won't be called unless the base class destructor is marked as virtual.
    - + Base* obj = new Derived(); delete obj; // Only Base destructor will be called
    -
    - + Should we make all destructors virtual?: https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/virtual-destructors-virtual-assignment-and-overriding-virtualization/
    --------

    --------
    - Override specifier
    - + Override ensures that the function is virtual and is overriding a virtual function from a 
    -base class
    - + Provides compile-time safety against mismatched signatures or missing virtual in the base 
    -class.
    - + Use for avoiding making mistakes when overiding function
    -
    - + Indicates that a member function is intended to be overridden by derived classes.
    - + Allows runtime polymorphism, enabling derived class functions to be called through base 
    -class pointers or references.
    --------

    --------
    - Final specifier
    - + Class level: If you do not intend your class to be inherited from, mark your class as final.  
    -This will prevent other classes from inheriting from it in the first place, without imposing 
    -any other use restrictions on the class itself.
    - + Methods & functions level: Prevent futher overriding on the Derived class
    - 
    --------

    --------
    - Pure Virtual Functions & Abstract Classes
    - + Abstract Class:
    -   - Cannot instantiate objects
    -   - These classes are used as base classes in inheritance 
    - + Concrete Class:
    -   - Can instantiate objects
    -
    - + Pure Virtual Functions:
    -   - Is a virtual function thats used to make a class abstract
    - 
    --------

    --------
    - Abstract Classes as Interface
    - Interface: An interface class is a class that has no member variables, and where all of the 
    -functions are pure virtual
