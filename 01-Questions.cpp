    why use initialize list
    how vector works behind

    optimization strategies
    recursive
    // user-defined  

    --OOP

    why base constructor is called first, then derived constructor whenever derived object is create
    why base constructor is call wherever derived object create
    why derived object need a base part
    slice
    so what is i have one base class and one derived class that has the same name member attributes,
    static biding 

    Animal* animals[] = { &myDog, &myCat };
    i have a question, a pointer point to base class Animal that has memory two derived class. how thats possible
    why c++ has to separate compile and run time to executed
    if Account is a base, Saving is a derived, and Trust is a derived from saving, does trust has two base part
    specifier & keywords
    early biding & late binding
