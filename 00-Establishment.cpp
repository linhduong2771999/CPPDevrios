    ⁈ Preface
        ⁂ On August 26, 2024, the Task Control or Center of Operation (TCCO) decided to start a new C++ project replacing 
    the former one, which named "Hoc hanh nghiem tuc" was created on September 25, 2022 (according to the "New Laptop" 
    date). The new official name of the project is "CPPDevrios" (meaning Development + Kyrios).

    ⁇ Why to create?
        ⁂ CPPDevrios aims to establish an impeccable and sustainable curriculum for learning and mastering C++ programming 
    language for beginners without any interruptions. In the past, many programmers detected a lot of mistakes and 
    errors from the previous project that had been crucial causes for the delay of learning c++, both internal and 
    external causes. With a clarity and firmness of mind from predecessors, they build and construct a whole new system 
    of learning c++ that deals with all its previous negative points for beginners easy to follow. 
    CPPDevrios fixes and repairs all the system encompassing the name, structure, style of leaning, and exercise.    
        ※ Motivation behind: In the past, the TCCO sent predecessors for learning designing website in order to build a frontend
    career. Initially, predecessors learned and noted many important knowledge from the internet in a very smooth way (meaning
    they did not have encounter any difficulties), they easily absorbed the knowledge and applied it into real world project,
    and unluckily, they were not very successful in their first projects.
        In reality, projects such as web portfolio, accounting management, or e-commerce did not reach the anticipated results  
    (but it also cannot be considered to be a failure, all still operate at a normal and acceptable level). This caused the TCCO
    gradually lose faith in designing website career. In the middle of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out and caused serious 
    economic crisis for the IT industry in general, leading to a saturation in the frontend sector in particular.
        Having predict and foresee the situation will not be good in the future, the TCCO advised predecessors to give up their 
    studying about website design and pursue other careers. With so many choices and options such as backend, software engineer, 
    UX-UI design, the TCCO decided to choose the major according to the predecessors' passion, which is game development (C++).

    ⁇ What is the purpose?
        ⁂ When the plan to chase web design falls to failure, TCCO redirected their predecessors to game development with the 
    core goal of gaining a stable position in the competitive system of jobs in society (of course, the important prerequisite 
    must acquire high profits and a favorable work environment). The initial "core goal" has led a number of important purposes
    that following it were also proposed in order to solidify the career path of its predecessors more securely, firmly, and 
    sustainably.
        "Maintaining a stable standing" has been pointed out the term "passion" - The enthusiasm for online and offline game 
    design of the predecessors is extremely strong, it has long been ingrained in their souls since childhood and persists until 
    now. Work accompanied by passion will infuse excitement in the profession, boost productivity while working, and keep the 
    mental mind steady for upcoming challenges in the future.
        "Extremely high self-independent opportunities" - the game design industry has long demonstrated that many individuals 
    have been achieved great success in terms of profits and standing within society's competitive structure. With confidence 
    in professional knowledge and clear plans provided by TCCO for their predecessors, they are sure that their path will yield 
    many pleasant fruits.
