    ⁈ Preface
    ⁂ On August 26, 2024, the Task Control or Center of Operation decided to start a new C++ project replacing 
    the former one, which named "Hoc hanh nghiem tuc" was created on September 25, 2022 (according to the "New Laptop" 
    date). The new official name of the project is "Devrios" (meaning Development + Kyrios).

    ⁇ Why to create
    ⁂ Devrios aims to establish an impeccable and sustainable curriculum for learning and mastering C++ programming 
    language for beginners without any interruptions. In the past, many programmers detected a lot of mistakes and 
    errors from the previous project that had been crucial causes for the delay of learning c++, both internal and 
    external causes. With a clarity and firmness of mind from predecessors, they build and construct a whole new system 
    of learning c++ that deals with all its previous negative points for beginners easy to follow. 
    Devrios fixs and repairs all the system encompassing the name, structure, style of leaning, and exercise.
